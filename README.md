# Google Classroom Video Downloader

A Chrome extension to download "View Only" videos in google classroom and drive.
A view only file in google drive is fetched in small chunks, with no option to download the whole file. This extension intercepts the network requests and manipulates the url to get back the whole file. The extension seemlessly integrates with Aria2 to download your files a lot faster than usual chrome downloads.

   ```
   ```bash
   # With token (recommended)
   aria2c --enable-rpc --rpc-listen-all=true --rpc-allow-origin-all --rpc-secret=YOUR_TOKEN
   ```
